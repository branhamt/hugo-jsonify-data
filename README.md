# A Demonstration of What You Can Do with Hugo's JSONify

Hugo can do a lot with your content. Since your content is just data, you can transform it, process it, and manipulate it. 

Hugo makes this easy with the [jsonify function](https://gohugo.io/functions/encoding/jsonify/).

This repo is an example of:

- Pulling data from content pages
- Transforming that data and running images through image processing
- Converting that data to JSON
- Delivering the data and images to another page so that it can be used by AlpineJS
